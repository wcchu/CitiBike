# CitiBike rental system

We study how riders used the CitiBike bike rental system in New York City in July 2014.

In "Part 1: Exploratory data analysis", we find the basic facts of how people used this system. The data is visually explored and summarized with basic time and location information. This analysis provides an intuitive understanding of the details in Part 2 and Part 3. Possible extension of this work is also discussed.

In "Part 2: Subscribers and customers", two groups of riders are differentiated by their behaviors. Subscribers (annual members) were mostly daily commuters, and customers (daily to weekly users) were mostly tourists or short-time visitors. We suggest how to expand the subscriber base and how to attract more short-term users based on their interests and convenience.

In "Part 3: Availabilities of bikes and parking spaces", we investigate the issues of insufficient available bikes and insufficient parking spaces in some stations at certain time. The manual relocation (shipping by trucks) of the bikes is identified, and its adjustment is suggested.
